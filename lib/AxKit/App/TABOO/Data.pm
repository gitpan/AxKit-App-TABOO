=head1 NAME

AxKit::App::TABOO::Data - Base class of abstracted Data objects for TABOO

=head1 DESCRIPTION

You would rarely if ever use this class directly. Instead, you would
call a subclass of this class, depending on what kind of data you are
operating on. This class does, however, define some very useful
methods that its subclasses can use unaltered.

It is to be noted that I have not, neither in this class nor in the
subclasses, created methods to access or set every field. Instead, I
rely mainly on methods that will manipulate internal data based on the
for example objects that are passed as arguments. For example, the
C<write_xml>-method (below), will create XML based on all the
available data in the object. This is usually all you want anyway.

In some subclasses, you will have some degree of control of what is
loaded into the object data structure in the first place, by sending
the names of the fields of the storage medium (e.g. database in the
present implementation).

Similarly, if data is sent from a web application, the present
implementation makes it possible to pass an L<Apache::Request> object
to a Data object, and it is up to a method of the Data object to take
what it wants from the Apache::Request object, and intelligently store
it.

Some methods to access data will be implemented on an ad hoc basis,
notably C<timestamp()>-methods, that will be important in determining
the validity of cached data.

Sometimes you might want to retrieve more than one object from the
data store, and do stuff on these objects as a whole.  Furthermore,
the load methods used to retrieve multiple objects may be optimized.
For this, TABOO also has Plural classes.


=head2 Methods

=over

=item C<new()>

The constructor of this class. Rarely used. 

=cut

sub new {
    my $that  = shift;
    my $class = ref($that) || $that;
    my $self = {
		ONFILE => undef,
		DBCONNECTARGS => [],
		XMLPREFIX => 'taboo',
		XMLELEMENT => 'taboo',
		XMLNS => 'http://www.kjetil.kjernsmo.net/software/TABOO/NS/Output'
	       };

    bless($self, $class);
    return $self;
}


=item C<load(what =E<gt> fields, limit =E<gt> {key =E<gt> value, [...]})>

Will load and populate the data structure of an object with the data
from a data store. It uses named parameters, the first C<what> is used
to determine which fields to retrieve. It is a string consisting of a
commaseparated list of fields, as specified in the data store. If not
given, all fields will be fetched. The C<limit> argument is to be used
to determine which records to retrieve, and must be used to identify a
record uniquely. It is itself a reference to a hash, containing data
store field values as keys and values are corresponding values to
retrieve. These will be combined by logical AND.

If there is no data that corresponds to the given arguments, this
method will return C<undef>.

=cut

sub load {
  my ($self, %args) = @_;
  my $data = $self->_load(%args);
  if ($data) {
    ${$self}{'ONFILE'} = 1;
  } else {
    return undef;
  }
  foreach my $key (keys(%{$data})) {
    ${$self}{$key} = Encode::decode_utf8(${$data}{$key}) 
  }
  return $self;
}


=item C<_load(what =E<gt> fields, limit =E<gt> {key =E<gt> value, [...]})>

As the underscore implies this is B<for internal use only>! It is
intended to do the hard work for this class and its subclasses. It
returns a hashref of the data from the datastore.


See the documentation for the C<load> method for the details on the
parameters.

=cut

sub _load {
    my ($self, %args) = @_;
    my $what = $args{'what'} || '*';
    my %arg =  %{$args{'limit'}};
    my $dbh = DBI->connect($self->dbconnectargs());
    # The subclass should give the dbfrom.
    my $query = "SELECT " . $what . " FROM " . $self->dbfrom() . " WHERE ";
    my $i=0;
    my $nothing=1;
    my @keys = keys(%arg);
    foreach my $key (@keys) {
      $i++;
      next unless ($arg{$key});
      $nothing = 0;
      $query .= $key . "=?";
      if ($i <= $#keys) {
	$query .= " AND ";
      }
    }
#    warn $query;
    if ($nothing) {
      # Then, none of the fields were actually sent with a value, so
      # load won't return anything sensible...
      carp "No fields were sent with value, so no unique record can be found";
      return undef;
    }
    my $sth = $dbh->prepare($query);
    $i=1;
    foreach my $key (@keys) {
      $sth->bind_param($i, $arg{$key});
      $i++;
    }
    $sth->execute();
    return $sth->fetchrow_hashref;
}

=item C<write_xml($doc, $parent)>

Takes arguments C<$doc>, which must be an L<XML::LibXML::Document>
object, and C<$parent>, a reference to the parent node. The method
will append the object it is handed it with the data contained in the
data structure of the class in XML. This method is the jewel of this
class, it should be sufficiently generic to rarely require
subclassing. References to subclasses will be followed, and
C<write_xml> will call the C<write_xml> of that object. Arrays will be
represented with multiple instances of the same element. Fields that
have undefined values will not be included. It will also parse fields
indicated by C<elementneedsparse()>, see below. Currently, we get HTML
from TinyMCE, which we let XML::LibXML parse.

=cut


sub write_xml {
    my $self = shift;
    my $doc = shift;
    my $parent = shift;
    my $topel = $doc->createElementNS($self->xmlns(),

	if (ref($content) =~ m/^AxKit::App::TABOO::Data/) {

        }
      }
    }
    return $doc;
}

=item C<populate(\%args)>

This method takes as argument a reference to a hash and will populate
the data object by adding any data from a key having the same name as
is used in the data storage. Fields that are not specified by the data
object or that has uppercase letters are ignored.

It may be used to insert data from a request by first noting that in a
HTTP request, the Request object is available as C<$r>, so you may
create the hash to hand to this method by

    my %args = $r->args;

Note that this only the case for HTTP GET, in the case of POST, you
may have to construct the hash by e.g.

    my %args = map { $_ => join('', $cgi->param($_)) } $cgi->param;

=cut


sub populate {
    my $self = shift;
    my $args = shift;
    foreach my $key (keys(%{$self})) {
	next if ($key =~ m/[A-Z]/); # Uppercase keys are not in db
	${$self}{$key} = Encode::decode_utf8(${$args}{$key});
    }
    return $self;
}

=item C<apache_request_changed(\%args)>

Like the above method, this method takes as argument a reference to
the args hash of a L<Apache::Request> object. Instead of populating
the Data object, it will compare the C<\%args> with the contents of
the object and return an array of fields that differs between the
two. Fields that are not specified by the data object, that has
uppercase letters or has no value, are ignored.


=cut


sub apache_request_changed {
    my $self = shift;
    my $args = shift;
    my @keys;
    foreach my $key (keys(%{$self})) {
	next if ($key =~ m/[A-Z]/); # Uppercase keys are not in db
	next unless defined(${$args}{$key}); # if it isn't there, we don't care.
	if (${$self}{$key} ne ${$args}{$key}) {
	  push(@keys, $key);
	}
    }
    return @keys;
}


=item C<save([$olddbkey])>

This is a generic save method, that will write a new record to the
data store, or update an old one. It may have to be subclassed for
certain classes. It takes an optional argument C<$olddbkey>, which is
the primary key of an existing record in the data store. You may
supply this in the case if you want to update the record with a new
key. In that case, you'd better be sure it actually exists, because
the method will trust you do.

It is not yet a very rigorous implementation: It may well fail badly
if it is given something with a reference to other Data objects, which
is the case if you have a full story with all comments. Or it may
cope. Only time will tell! Expect to see funny warnings in your logs
if you try.


=cut

sub save {
  my $self = shift;
  my $olddbkey = shift;
  my $dbh = DBI->connect($self->dbconnectargs());
  my @fields;
  my $i=0;
  foreach my $key (keys(%{$self})) {
      next if ($key =~ m/[A-Z]/); # Uppercase keys are not in db
      next unless defined(${$self}{$key}); # No need to insert something that isn't there
      push(@fields, $key);
      $i++;
  }
  if ($i == 0) {
      carp "No data fields with anything to save";
  } else {
      my $sth;
      my $dbkey = ${$self}{$self->dbprimkey()};
      # First we check if we should update rather than insert
      if (($olddbkey) || ($self->stored)) {
	${$self}{'ONFILE'} = 1;
	# Yep, we update, but do we change the primary key?
	if ($olddbkey) { 
	  $dbkey = $olddbkey;
	}
	$sth = $dbh->prepare("UPDATE ". $self->dbtable() . " SET " . join('=?,', @fields) . "=? WHERE " . $self->dbprimkey() . "=?");
	
      } else {
	$sth = $dbh->prepare("INSERT INTO ". $self->dbtable() . " (" . join(',', @fields) . ") VALUES (" . '?,' x ($i-1) . '?)');
      }
      $i = 1;
      foreach my $key (@fields) {
	  my $content = ${$self}{$key};
	  if (ref($content) eq '') {
	      $sth->bind_param($i, $content);
	  } elsif (ref($content) eq "ARRAY") {
	      # The content is an array, save it as such, ad hoc SQL3 for now.
	      $sth->bind_param($i, "{" . join(',', @{$content}) . "}");
	  } else {
	    # Actually, I should never get here, but anyway...:
	      warn "Advanced forms of references aren't implemented meaningfully yet. Don't be surprised if I crash or corrupt something.";
	      $content->save(); # IOW: Panic!! Everybody save yourselves if you can! :-)
	  }
	  $i++;
      }
      if (${$self}{'ONFILE'}) {
	  $sth->bind_param($i, $dbkey);
      }
      $sth->execute();
  }
  return $self;
}


=item C<exist(%limitargs)>

This method can be used to check if a record allready exists. The
argument is the hash you would give to C<limit> in the load method.

=cut

sub exist {
  my $self = shift;
  my %args = @_;
  my $data = $self->_load(what => 1, limit => \%args);
  return scalar($data);
}


=item C<stored()>

Checks if a record with the present object's identifier is allready
present in the datastore. Returns 1 if this is so.

=cut

# TODO, this needs to be more generic, should probably use _load.
sub stored {
  my $self = shift;
  return 1 if ${$self}{'ONFILE'};
  my $dbh = DBI->connect($self->dbconnectargs());
  my $check = scalar($dbh->selectrow_array("SELECT 1 FROM " . $self->dbtable() . " WHERE " . $self->dbprimkey() . "=?", {}, ${$self}{$self->dbprimkey()}));
  ${$self}{'ONFILE'} = $check;
  return $check;
}



=item C<onfile>

Method to set a flag to indicate that the record is in the data store.

=cut

  
sub onfile {
  my $self = shift;
  ${$self}{'ONFILE'} = 1;
  return $self;
}

=item C<dbconnectargs(@args)>

This method will set or retrieve the arguments that are passed to
L<DBI>'s C<connect> method. Since this needs to be done for every
object, you may also pass these arguments to the C<new> constructor of
each subclass. However, it is recommended that you use environment
variables instead.

=cut

sub dbconnectargs {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) {
    ${$self}{'DBCONNECTARGS'} = \@_;
  }
  return @{${$self}{'DBCONNECTARGS'}};
} 


=item C<elementneedsparse($string)>

User-supplied formatting may not be valid XHTML, and so needs to be
validated and parsed. This method takes a string consisting of a
comma-separated list of fields that needs parsing as argument, or will
return such a list if it is not given.

=item C<xmlelement($string)>

This method is I<intended> for internal use, but if you can use it
without shooting somebody in the foot (including yourself), fine by
me... It sets the root element that will enclose an
object's data to C<$string>, or return it if not given.

=cut


sub xmlelement {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) { 
    ${$self}{'XMLELEMENT'} = shift;
  }
  return ${$self}{'XMLELEMENT'};
}


=item C<xmlns($string)>

Like C<xmlelement()>, this method is I<intended> for internal
use. It sets the namespace URI of the XML representation of an object
to C<$string>, or return it if not given.

=cut



sub xmlns {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) { 
    ${$self}{'XMLNS'} = shift;
  }
  return ${$self}{'XMLNS'};
}


=item C<xmlprefix($string)>

Alse like C<xmlelement()>, this method is I<intended> for internal
use. It sets the namespace prefix of the XML representation of an
object to C<$string>, to allow using QNames, or return it if not given.


=back

=cut



sub xmlprefix {
  my $self = shift;
  if (@_) { 
    ${$self}{'XMLPREFIX'} = shift;
  }
  return ${$self}{'XMLPREFIX'};
}



#=item C<elementorder($string)>

#This string contains a comma-separated list of all fields of a class that will be included in the XML, and in the order specified.


# Some inheritable methods and defaults

=head1 STORED DATA

The data is stored in named fields, currently in a database, but there
is nothing stopping you from subclassing the Data classes and storing
it somewhere else. TABOO should work well, but if you want to make it
less painful for yourself, you should use the same names or provide
some kind of mapping between your names and the names in these Data
classes. Note that any similarity between these names and the internal
names of this class is purely coincidential (eh, not really).

Consult the documentation for each individual Data class for the names
of the stored data.


=head1 BUGS/TODO

There is the issue with the handling of references to other objects in
the C<save()> method. I think it may actually cope in most cases, but
it definately could use some more attention.
