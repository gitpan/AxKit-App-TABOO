0.01_02  2003-12-11 09:57
	- Struggling to get the packaging right...

0.01_03  2003-12-11 09:57
	- A missing ; after the final 1 made make test complain in Comment.pm

0.011  	 2003-12-11 15:23
	- Hm, huh...? PAUSE won't extract the README and it is not being 
	  indexed.... There must be something very wrong with the package. 
          The version number...?
	- Added ; after the 1's in User and Category just to be sure. 

0.02  	 2004-02-01 00:10
	- Added 
		* AxKit::App::TABOO::Data::User::Contributor
		* AxKit::App::TABOO::XSP::Story
		* AxKit::App::TABOO::XSP::User
		* AxKit::App::TABOO::XSP::Category
	- Made internal class variables lower case for those pulled from DB
	- Removed the use of Alias (how did we do that in SIMULA...?) 
	- Remove XML::Writer to use XML::LibXML for everything
	- Added methods:
		* In AxKit::App::TABOO::Data
			+ apache_request_data
			+ save
			+ stored
		* In AxKit::App::TABOO::Data::Category
			+ all_of_type
	- Made most internal DBI queries throw Exception::Class::DBI
	exceptions in case of failures. I have been unsuccessful in
	catching them, so it is not quite like I want it yet, and
	changes in this must be expected.  
	- Quite a lot of minor changes in the internals.
	
0.021_1	  2004-02-14 00:10
	- Throwing a slightly unfinished development version out the
	door for various reasons. 
	- Adds namespaces to all XML representations. The namespace
	can be set by an xmlns() method, but has sensible defaults.
	- New elements
		* AxKit::App::TABOO::XSP::Story
		 	+ this_story
		* AxKit::App::TABOO::XSP::User
			+ this_user
			+ store (not very well tested)
	- Added an username attribute to is_authorized, to allow for
	checking access for a particular user (e.g. the owner). 
	- Starting to add version numbers to all files.
