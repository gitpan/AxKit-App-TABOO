0.2	2005-04-19 05:25
	The changes from 0.1 is really too large to specify in
	detail, but I'll list some important:
	- The SQL has changed to use more SERIAL ids, some of the
	  changes are incompatible with TABOO 0.1. Upgrading isn't hard,
	  but I dropped everything... 
	- Article Data objects, Providers and XSP Taglibs.
	  * Can use many formats, including OpenOffice.org, using that
	    Provider, or the Formatter provider.
	- A Classification Provider, which helps with finding content
	  based on category information.
	- A lot more XSLT, and quite a few XSP. 
	- Things that couldn't save before now does.
	- New dependencies on Encode 2.09, MIME:Types
	- Nicer CSS.
