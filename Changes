0.01_01  2003-12-08 18:06:47 2003
	- First release created. 

0.01_02  2003-12-11 09:57
	- Struggling to get the packaging right...

0.01_03  2003-12-11 09:57
	- A missing ; after the final 1 made make test complain in Comment.pm

0.011  	 2003-12-11 15:23
	- Hm, huh...? PAUSE won't extract the README and it is not being 
	  indexed.... There must be something very wrong with the package. 
          The version number...?
	- Added ; after the 1's in User and Category just to be sure. 

0.02  	 2004-02-01 00:10
	- Added 
		* AxKit::App::TABOO::Data::User::Contributor
		* AxKit::App::TABOO::XSP::Story
		* AxKit::App::TABOO::XSP::User
		* AxKit::App::TABOO::XSP::Category
	- Made internal class variables lower case for those pulled from DB
	- Removed the use of Alias (how did we do that in SIMULA...?) 
	- Remove XML::Writer to use XML::LibXML for everything
	- Added methods:
		* In AxKit::App::TABOO::Data
			+ apache_request_data
			+ save
			+ stored
		* In AxKit::App::TABOO::Data::Category
			+ all_of_type
	- Made most internal DBI queries throw Exception::Class::DBI
	exceptions in case of failures. I have been unsuccessful in
	catching them, so it is not quite like I want it yet, and
	changes in this must be expected.  
	- Quite a lot of minor changes in the internals.
	
0.021_1	  2004-02-14 00:10
	- Throwing a slightly unfinished development version out the
	door for various reasons. 
	- Adds namespaces to all XML representations. The namespace
	can be set by an xmlns() method, but has sensible defaults.
	- New elements
		* AxKit::App::TABOO::XSP::Story
		 	+ this_story
		* AxKit::App::TABOO::XSP::User
			+ this_user
			+ store (not very well tested)
	- Added an username attribute to is_authorized, to allow for
	checking access for a particular user (e.g. the owner). 
	- Starting to add version numbers to all files. 
		
0.021_2	  2004-02-16 23:10  
	- Added version numbers to all files
	- Added an ONFILE data member which is used internally to
	check whether we can expect to find the object in the
	storage. This is set by all methods that load something,
	making it possible for save-methods to know whether to INSERT
	or UPDATE. 
	- Added a save-method to AxKit::App::TABOO::Data::User::Contributor.
	- Reviewed the changes of the previous upload. 

0.021	  2004-02-18 11:10  
	- Added a apache_request_changed to AxKit::App::TABOO::Data
	- Fixed a bug in the code to check whether to insert or update.
	- Changed the test to check if there is anything in the
	variable to next unless defined().
	- A few small changes in the POD.
	- Actually tested AxKit::App::TABOO::XSP::User <store> - it 
	seems to work! 

0.03	  2004-02-19 23:00
	- Reworking the packaging completely, trying to include the
	XML files (XSP, XSLT) that I'm working on, as well as some
	test data in SQL.
	- With the inclusion of XSP, we require AxKit::XSP::QueryParam.
	- A new and ugly tag valid-authlevels in
	AxKit::App::TABOO::XSP::User. 

0.031	  2004-02-27 22:15
	- Now that DBD::Pg 1.32 is out, we depend on it. 
	- Cleaned up and fixed a few things in the authlevel code, 
	affecting mainly AxKit::App::TABOO::XSP::User.
	- Actually tested that authentication works OK. 
	- Quite a lot of changes in the XSP and XSLT.
	- Fixed a few typos. 

0.032	  2004-03-19 11:15
	- Fixed some bugs in the News Provider, which made it fail to
	encapsulate headings of comments in a "commentlist" element.
	- The News Prover exists method now does some real checking,
	but I also discovered it is inadequate, because if the record
	doesn't exist, there will be an error long before it gets
	here... That's a TODO. 
	- Added an editorok method to AxKit::App::TABOO::Data::Story.
	- ...and used that to have the News Provider check if the
	story should be displayed. 
	- Added a number of XSLT things. This has been my main pain the
	last few weeks. If you are in the position to ease my pain,
	please do, but it is not for the faint at heart... :-)
	- Added dependency on XML::LibXML 1.57
	- A few notes on that my Data objects need more work when it
	comes to plurals.
